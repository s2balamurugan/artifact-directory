Title:
<Applications of Fairness: Label Bias and Recovery of Ground Truth>

Abstract:
<Our work this quarter focuses on latent variable discovery of fair labels. This
fairness algorithm and its accuracy will be evaluated on a variety of datasets,
including common fairness datasets from UCI Adults, German Credit Scores,
and Compas (recidivism data). The objective of this algorithm is to reduce
unfair biases that are affected by sensitive features within the data. These
biases can significantly impact predictive models, leading to unfair outcomes
that disproportionately affect certain groups. Since these models often rely
on sensitive attributes rather than unbiased patterns, ensuring fairness in pre-
dictions remains a critical challenge.>
